	 * The specification states the following:
	 * 
	 * The temperature is expressed in Celsius and simplified to full degrees (e.g. 10 for 10 degrees 
	 * Celsius, or -5 for minus 5 degrees Celsius). 
	 * The sky parameter is obtained from another service that interprets the looks of the sky 
	 * (either by an AI using a webcam-based image, or by a low-payed employee looking out of the 
	 * window all day and regularly pressing a button).
	 * Temperatures under -15 degrees are not possible and result in an Error weather prediction.
	 * If the sky is Cloudy or Mixed, the prediction is always Rainy
	 * If the temperature is less than +15 degrees, the prediction is Rainy.
	 * If the Sky is Clear and the temperature is +15 degrees or more, the prediction is Sunny. 
	 * 
	 * @param variable1 The temperature in degrees Celsius
	 * @param sky The visual property of the sky
	 * @return The prediction of the weather

	 * The method is used by an airline booking system to automatically determine the amount of insurance 
	 * travelers must pay for their ticket. The following rules apply:
	 * 
	 * Travelers can bring a maximum of two pieces of equipment --- a maximum of one piece of sports 
	 * equipment and a maximum of one piece of musical equipment.
	 * The standard cost for one piece of equipment --- either sports or music equipment --- is €10 each. This 
	 * means, if they only bring one piece of equipment, the standard price of the insurance is €10; if they bring 
	 * two, the standard price is €20.
	 * If they bring no equipment, then standard insurance fee is 5€, but Business and First Class Travelers 
	 * do not need to pay for this. Both Business and First Class Travelers pay €0 in that case.
	 * Business Travelers get 50% discount on the total amount if they have any equipment.
	 * First Class Travelers have their insurance included. They always pay €0 regardless if they have 
	 * nothing, or any combination of equipment. 
	 * 
	 * @param sportsEquipment True if the traveler brings one piece of sports equipment
	 * @param musicEquipment True if the traveler brings one piece of music equipment
	 * @param ticketType The type of airline ticket that this customer holds (as defined by TicketType)
